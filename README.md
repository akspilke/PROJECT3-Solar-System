# PROJECT3-Solar-System

This program makes a model of the Solar System. The Euler and Verlet classes define the integration methods, vec3 defines vectors and operations, celestial bodies makes a function to create celestial bodies and solar system creates a solar system with all necessary forces, positions and velocities. In order to run the program one needs to uncomment the desired part; for the Earth-Sun system only the Earth and Sun "createcelestialbody" lines need to be included, while for larger systems include whatever planets you want. For the perihelion calculation for Mercury, uncomment everything underneath the Perihelion of Mercury comment.

All figures are found in the Figures folder, all text files in the TextFiles folder, the iPython notebooks to plot our results are in Python notebook files and our C++ programs are in the Solar System folder.
